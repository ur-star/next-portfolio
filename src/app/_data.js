  const intro = `I’m a software engineer with nearly 3 years of experience turning complex problems into elegant, scalable web solutions. I build everything from sleek UIs to powerful backend engines using technologies like React, Vue.js, Node.js, and TypeScript.
   Whether it’s dashboards, integrations, or entire applications, I bring ideas to life—clean, fast, and pixel-perfect.. My passion for
                    coding and problem-solving has driven me to work on a wide
                    range of projects, delivering innovative solutions that
                    improve user experiences, streamline processes, and create
                    measurable impact. I’ve contributed to the development of key
                    product features, including real-time dashboards and
                    user-driven enhancements. I’ve also led the successful
                    projects, which resulted in a more than 21% boost in user time
                    spent on the app and a 25% reduction in project timelines. In
                    addition to my work on user-centric products, I have
                    experience developing and maintaining robust data pipelines,
                    implementing server-side capabilities, and working with
                    popular charting libraries for data visualization. I also
                    possess hands-on experience with React, Node.js, and AWS,
                    working on web application development and deployment. I’m
                    dedicated to creating meaningful and user-centric solutions
                    that not only meet business needs but also elevate the user
                    experience. My strong technical foundation, combined with a
                    drive for continuous learning and improvement, motivates me to
                    always deliver value and push the boundaries of what’s
                    possible.`
